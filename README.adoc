= NSLU2 (SLUG)

== Background
When I came to pass on the NSLU2 I had, it had an alternative firmware installed.  The chap I was handing it to just 
wanted a cheap way to serve up content from a disk to his kids' devices, so reverting to the original Linksys 
firmware made sense.  It wasn't straightforward after all the time that's gone by, Cisco/Linksys have taken down 
their FTP servers and google caches were the only way to lookup the relevent info.

This project is my record to help retrace the same path.

This site was the go-to place for all things NSLU2, but no content is left now beyond the front page, Google Webcache to the rescue

After the restore I found that I couldn't complete configuration because of an error message "Fail to get samba information"

To fix it I had to reset the SysConf area and redo the firmware flash
